# Student-Management-System
A very simple project on Student Management System that includes HTML, CSS, MySQL, Spring Boot tools and XML dependencies. The project contains features for adding a new student to the database, viewing the full database, updating and retrieving the data of specific student. As a new bie with Spring Boot framework, I put on the stuffs I learnt in Java for effiecient handling of database through front end by using XML dependencies, Hibernate tools and Spring Boot techniques.
